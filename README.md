# Some info about Jeff
Hi, I'm Jeff Ellenbogen and I am practicing with my new GitHub for dummies book

## My Experience
I am just getting comfortable with git and using gitHub on the web, on the Mac via GitHub Desktop, and via command line on Raspberry Pi and Mac.

## GitHub so far
One thing I am enjoying is coding on my Mac via Sublime Text and then pushing changes (pulling too) via GitHub Desktop. Then I am using command line on the rasp pi to pull changes. So far, the Mac Desktop app is much easier than the terminal, but I like learning to use GitHub in a variety of ways!
